# Hyperion Identity Intelligence

Hyperion Identity Intelligence is a software designed to bring identity-related information from multiple enterprise sources into a consolidated view for identity governance, security analysis, and operational review.

It is intended to help administrators understand identity relationships, identify stale or inconsistent records, and review access-related information across distributed environments.

## The Problem

Enterprise identity information is commonly spread across separate directories, cloud services, administrative tools, and business systems. When each source is reviewed independently:

- Identity records can be difficult to reconcile across systems.
- Stale, inactive, or inconsistent accounts may be harder to identify.
- Privileged-user and access-related context can be fragmented.
- Manual review can require switching between tools and assembling information by hand.

These challenges can make identity governance and security reviews more time-consuming and less consistent.

## The Solution

Hyperion is designed to provide a consolidated identity-intelligence layer across configured enterprise sources. It brings identity-related information into a common application experience so administrators can review records and relationships in context.

The software focuses on supporting:
- Multi-source identity visibility and review
- Identification of stale or inconsistent identity records
- Privileged-user visibility and access-related analysis
- Identity governance and operational workflows

Hyperion is intended to complement existing identity providers and enterprise systems rather than replace them. Actual capabilities depend on the modules, integrations, and configuration present in the deployed version.

## Key Capabilities

Depending on the configured modules and connected data sources, Hyperion includes or is designed to support:

- Identity lifecycle and bulk identity operations
- Multi-source identity visibility and user intelligence
- Stale-account and inconsistent-identity review
- Enterprise search
- Privileged-user visibility and access-related analysis
- Exchange administration
- Cloud and governance visibility
- Device intelligence and unified inventory
- Power BI usage analytics

Verify individual capabilities against the current source code and configuration.

## Architecture

Hyperion uses a modular web-application architecture.

At a high level:
- **Web interface:** React/TypeScript application experience.
- **Feature and component layer:** Modular interface components and feature areas.
- **Gateway/integration layer:** Gateway modules and adapters for configured systems.
- **Server and authentication:** Node.js server-side code and authentication-related modules.
- **Enterprise sources and review outputs:** Actual sources and workflows depend on deployment configuration.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following main areas (where present in the checked-out version):

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `auth-system/` | Authentication-related modules |
| `components/` | User-interface components |
| `docs/` | Project documentation and diagrams |
| `features/` | Feature-specific code |
| `hooks/` | Reusable application hooks |
| `mock-data/` | Mock or demonstration data |
| `modules/` | Modular application functionality |
| `services/` | Supporting services and integrations |
| `src/` | Application source |
| `App.tsx` | Main application component |
| `server.js` | Server entry point |
| `package.json` | Project scripts and dependencies |

Folder contents may vary by branch or version.

## Requirements

- Node.js (a supported LTS release compatible with the project dependencies)
- npm, included with Node.js

Some integrations may require additional credentials, services, or environment-specific configuration.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hina-saif64/Hyperion-Identity-Intelligence.git
cd Hyperion-Identity-Intelligence
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Review the example environment file, if included (such as `.env.example`). Create a local `.env` file only if required by the project configuration.

**Never commit `.env` files containing secrets, credentials, API keys, tokens, or certificates.** Use placeholders in shared example files.

### 4. Run the application

Check the `scripts` section of `package.json` for commands supported by the checked-out version. For a Vite-based development setup, the command is commonly:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If frontend and backend scripts are separate, use the commands defined in `package.json` and project documentation.

### 5. Build and test

Use only scripts defined in `package.json`. Common commands may include:

```bash
npm run build
npm test
```

These require the corresponding scripts, source files, and dependencies to be present.

## Security Notes

- Never publish real credentials or secret environment files.
- Use least-privilege accounts when connecting Hyperion to enterprise systems.
- Test integrations in a non-production environment before enabling changes to identity records or access controls.
- Review authentication, authorization, configuration, and logging before production use.
- Treat mock or demonstration data as non-production data.

## Project Status

Hyperion is under development. Features, integrations, setup instructions, and runtime behaviour may vary by version. Validate the checked-out code and configuration before using it in a live environment.

## External Evaluation

Hyperion has been evaluated in external organisational contexts. Claims about implementation outcomes, performance improvements, or measured operational impact should be supported by the relevant organisation's confirmation and limited to the scope of its evaluation.

## Contributing

Contributions, issue reports, and code reviews are welcome. For substantial changes:
1. Describe the problem and proposed change.
2. Keep changes focused and documented.
3. Include tests or reproducible validation where practical.
4. Do not include credentials, customer data, or confidential information in commits.

## Responsible Use

Use Hyperion only in systems and environments for which you have appropriate authorisation. Handle identity data in accordance with applicable security, privacy, and organisational requirements.
